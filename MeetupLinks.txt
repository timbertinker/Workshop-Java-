[ To Paste into Meetup conversation, for LJC Introduction to Java Workshop 25/10/2016 
Dropped the reference to setup.pdf and alt zip download, they can find it from the gdoc (and I deleted it, too old, and everyone was OK with Git or SourceTree) ] 

Hi All, 

Hopefully you have setup Java, Eclipse and Git by now.
 
At the event we will be using some Java examples and exercises. Download and import them as below, and follow the README.txt:
 git clone https://github.com/LondonJavaCommunity/JavaWorkshop.git

Look forward to seeing you tomorrow night!
