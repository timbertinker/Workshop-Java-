Hi All, 

Hopefully you have setup Java, Eclipse and Git by now.
 
At the event we will be using some Java examples and exercises. Download and import them as below, and follow the README.txt:
 git clone https://github.com/mikebgx/LJCworkspace.git 

Also please bookmark https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P1H0h4oCoW04nS5PutnGmxz0R6i4Q_NXj_1-C80-DGw/edit?usp=sharing
 for alternative non-Git zip download, other details and late-breaking news.  

Look forward to seeing you tomorrow night!  
Mike, John & Omar.
